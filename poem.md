#The Morning Of Life.
*By Victor-Marie Hugo*

The mist of the morning is torn by the peaks,<br/>
Old towers gleam white in the ray, <br/>
And already the glory so joyously seeks <br/>
The lark that's saluting the day.

Then smile away, man, at the heavens so fair, <br/>
Though, were you swept hence in the night, <br/>
From your dark, lonely tomb the owlets would stare <br/>
At the sun rising newly as bright.


But out of earth's trammels your soul would have flown <br/>
Where glitters Eternity's stream, <br/>
And you shall have waked 'midst pure glories unknown, <br/>
As sunshine disperses a dream.
